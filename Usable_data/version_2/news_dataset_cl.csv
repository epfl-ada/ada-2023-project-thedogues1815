Studies examining the potential integration of nucleic acid vaccines into DNA have shown that RNA from a vaccine does not alter DNA. RNA from a vaccine is also very unlikely to cause autoimmunity, as RNA is short-lived, being quickly degraded by cells after it has been used to make a protein. Therefore RNA does not persist long enough to cause autoimmune disorders, which are chronic in nature. In fact, some nucleic acid vaccines are being developed to treat autoimmune diseases.", United States," Alex Pietrowski, Waking Times; Facebook users"

Preliminary results from small-scale animal studies suggest that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Oxford researchers may protect against viral pneumonia. However, researchers did find viral genetic material in nasal passages of vaccinated monkeys. Therefore, some scientists have cautioned that the vaccine may provide only partial protection against disease and may not prevent virus shedding and its spread to unvaccinated individuals. Bill Gates is not the developer, producer or sole funder of the vaccine; financial backing for the production of the Oxford vaccine has come from several sources including the U.K. government.
